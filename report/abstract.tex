\begin{abstract}
This document contains a report on the project created by Gabriele Maurina for the exam Statistical Methods for Machine Learning. The project focuses on using artificial neural networks(ANNs) to perform image classification on a dataset from Keggle.com. The dataset contains 90380 images of fruits and vegetables. The project is divided into two experiments. The first experiment trains and evaluates several models with the objective to classify images based on 10 base types, namely "apple", "banana", "cherry", "grape", "peach", "pear", "pepper", "plum", "potato" and "tomato". The second experiment trains and evaluates several models with the objective to classify images based on all 131 labels contained in the dataset. The total number of networks trained and evaluated across both experiments is 300, of which 150 are fully connected deep neural networks (DNNs) and 150 are convolutional neural networks(CNNs).
The experimental results show that on average CNNs achieve a lower Zero-One loss on the testing set than DNNs. Furthermore, in the experiment with only 10 labels, CNNs and DNNs achieve similar accuracy and loss, whereas in the experiment with 131 labels, CNNs tend to outperform non-CNNs on accuracy and loss. The best networks for experiment 1 and experiment 2 score very good results, with a zero-one loss on the test set of 1\% and 5\% respectively.
