This document contains a report on the project created by Gabriele Maurina for the exam Statistical Methods for Machine Learning. The project focuses on using artificial neural networks to perform image classification on a dataset from the website Keggle. The dataset contains 90380 images of fruits and vegetables. The project is divided into two experiments. The first experiment trains and evaluates several models with the objective to classify images based on 10 base types, namely "apple", "banana", "cherry", "grape", "peach", "pear", "pepper", "plum", "potato", "tomato". The second experiment trains and evaluates several models with the objective to classify images based on all 131 labels contained in the dataset.
