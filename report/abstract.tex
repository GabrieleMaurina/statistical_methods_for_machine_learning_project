This document contains a report on the project created by Gabriele Maurina for the exam Statistical Methods for Machine Learning. The project focuses on using artificial neural networks(ANNs) to perform image classification on a dataset from Keggle.com. The dataset contains 90380 images of fruits and vegetables. The project is divided into two experiments. The first experiment trains and evaluates 150 ANNs with the objective to classify images based on 10 base types, namely "apple", "banana", "cherry", "grape", "peach", "pear", "pepper", "plum", "potato" and "tomato". The second experiment trains and evaluates 150 ANNs with the objective to classify images based on all 131 labels contained in the dataset. Both experiment use Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), of which half are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The experimental results show that on average CNNs achieve a lower zero-one loss on the testing set than plain DNNs. The best networks for experiment 1 and experiment 2 are both CNNs and score a zero-one loss on the testing set of 1\% and 5\% respectively.
