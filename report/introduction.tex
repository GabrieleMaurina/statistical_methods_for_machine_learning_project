\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are machine learning models loosely inspired by biological neural networks found in human and animal brains. ANNs consist of a set of nodes, called artificial neurons, connected to each other by edges. Nodes can send and receive signals, i.e. real numbers, through their edges. Upon receiving a signal from other nodes, a node processes said signal and can signal other nodes. Tipically a node output is a function of all its inputs. Nodes can be aggregated into layers, where usually nodes from the first layer forward signals to nodes in the next layer, which, in turn, forward signals to the next layer and the forwarding is repeated until the last layer is reached.
