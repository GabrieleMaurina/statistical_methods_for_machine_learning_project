\section{Experiment 2}
\label{sec:exp2}
Experiment 2, similarly to experiment 1, trains and evaluates ANNs on the task to classify images of fruits and vegetables. Experiment 2, however, considers 131 labels, making the classification task more challenging. The goal of the experiment, as in experiment 1, is to try different network types in order to find the best configuration, i.e., the configuration with the lowest Zero-One loss, and to see if the best configuration for experiment 1, still holds for experiment 2.
